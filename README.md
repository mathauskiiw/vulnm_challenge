Greetings, this repository holds the code for a Django REST API for storing/retrieving info about assets and their vulnerabilities

  

## API

  

This repository features a fully *containerized* environment consisting of the following images:

  

- Django (version 3.1.2)

  

- PostgreSQL (latest)

  

- Nginx (mainline-alpine)

  

  

#### Other information

  

- OS

  

-- [Manjaro (Kernel 5.8.16-2)](https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/)

  

- Language

  

-- [Python 3.8.5](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/)

  

--- Libraries used:

  

djangorestframework=3.12.1

  

psycopg2-binary=2.8.6

  

gunicorn=20.0.4

  

django-extensions=3.0.9

  

  

# Setup

  

1. Requisites

  

* Install docker & docker-compose

  

  

* Clone the repository localy

  

  

> $ git clone git@github.com:mathauskiiw/vulnm_challenge.git

  

  

* Then, paste a project.ENV at the project's root

  

  

> $ cp ~/<project.ENV  file  path> ./vulnm_challenge

  

  

* Place a .csv file into the *commands* folder *(optional)*

  

  

> $ cp ~/<*.csv  file  path> ./djangobackend/api/management/commands/

  

  

2. Instalation & Docker

  

* To run the application, simply run the docker-compose file from projects' root:

  

  

> $ docker-compose up --build

  

  

* Docker will automatically download and build the images, create the database, make migrations and migrate. after that the service is gonna be available at:

  

  

> localhost:1337/

  

  

-- Commands

  

* To run any manage.py command, you need to detach the django container from the rest of the containers after running "$ docker-compose run --build", type on another terminal:

  

  

> docker rm -f django

  

  

* And run it separately

  

  

> docker-compose run web python manage.py {your manage.py command}

  

* To reset the database, run:

>docker-compose run web python manage.py reset_db --noinput

  

3. Postman

  

To ease the operation, there's a postman collection that contains the API endpoints for the application located at :

  

[/vulnm_challenge/postman/djangoapi.postman_collection.json](https://github.com/mathauskiiw/vulnm_challenge/blob/master/postman/djangoapi.postman_collection.json)

 

Only need to import it into postman and send requests while the server is running.

4. Authentication

During the setup, the application tries to create a user with the credentials on the project.env.

The endpoints in the application are login protected, to access their data first go to login page and send a POST with form params 'username' and 'password' , data now should be displayed.

# Structure

  

  

## Models

  

The following models where implemented to attain the desired behavior, those where:

  

### Asset

  

1. Summary:

  

- Asset model represents the machines imported from the file.

  

2. Attributes:

  

- Asset.pk -> Primary Key field

  

- Asset.hostname -> String field

  

- Asset.ip_address -> String field with IPV4 mask validation

  

- Asset.vulns -> Foreign Key field ( to Vulnerability model as Many to Many)

  

3. Properties (Dynamically updated):

  

- Asset.risk

#=> returns the ratio of the **risk** of vulns not solved by the **count** vulns not solved

  

- Asset.vuln_count

#=> returns the count of vulnerabilities linked to this asset that weren't solved

  

  

### Vulnerability

  

1. Summary:

  

- Vulnerability model represents the vulnerabilities imported with the assets

  

2. Attributes:

  

- Vulnerability.pk -> Primary Key field

  

- Vulnerability.title -> String field

  

- Vulnerability.severity -> String field

  

- Vulnerability.cvss -> Float field (0 to 10 validation)

  

- Vulnerability.pub_date -> Date field

  

- Vulnerability.hosts -> Foreign Key field( to Assets model)

  

3. Properties (Dynamically updated):

  

- Vulnerabity.affected_count

#=> returns the count of hosts currently affected by this vulnerability (Solved = False)

  

  

### VulnStatus

  

1. Summary:

  

- Through model to represent the Asset<->Vulnerability relation and store the vulnerability status (solved or not).

  

- Each VulnStatus is unique for a (Asset, Vulnerability) pair

  

2. Attributes:

  

- VulnStatus.solved-> Boolean field

  

  

## Endpoints

  

### Assets

  

-  [GET] -> /assets/?page=1

  

-- Asset list *(pagination parameter optional)*

  

-  [GET] -> /assets/?vuln=20

  

-- Asset list filtering by vulnerabilty_pk

  

-  [GET] -> /assets/<asset_pk>

  

-- Asset detail view

  

-  [PUT] -> /assets/<asset_pk>/vuln/<vuln_pk>

  

-- Update the solved status for the specified asset's vulnerability (has a toggle behavior)

  

  

### Vulnerability

  

-  [GET] -> /vulnerabilities/?page=1

  

-- Vulnerabilities list *(pagination parameter optional)*

  

-  [GET] -> /vulnerability/?asset=1&severity=baixo

  

-- Vulnerabilities list fltering by asset or/and severity

  

  

### Auth

  

- [GET, POST] -> /auth/login/

  

-- Login page

  

-  [POST] -> /auth/logout/

  

-- Logout
